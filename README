minctweet (Minecraft Tweet) is a simple, blandly named Python script
that will monitor a Minecraft server log file and react to 
chosen in-game events by pushing tweets to a Twitter account.

The script uses Unix tail, which effectively restricts its use to
Linux and OS X. Sorry to those on other platforms!

Enjoy!
