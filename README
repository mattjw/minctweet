minctweet (Minecraft Tweet) is a simple, blandly named Python script
that will monitor a Minecraft server log file and react to 
chosen in-game events by pushing tweets to a Twitter account.

The script uses Unix tail, which effectively restricts its use to
Linux and OS X. Sorry to those on other platforms!

Usage:
Execute minctweet.py.
The script requires the path to a configuration file as an argument. 
The configuration file should specify the location of the server log
file and Twitter authentication information.
See example.config for an indication of the configuration file format.

Some assembly required:
Customising responses to log events requires editing the script itself. 
Logic for this can be found in function handle_log_entry. 

Enjoy!
